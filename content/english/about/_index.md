###### My interests

I am currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly Pomona, with a minor in Mathematics. I have always loved math, and have been programming since I was in middle school. I am extremely passionate about what I do and love (almost) every second of it.

I am a very curious person, and aspire to be a lifelong learner. I love learning about anything tech related. For me, the best part of learning is not the destination, but rather the journey. Learning is the end goal, not knowing.

###### What I do

Currently, I am working on a robotics team known as Project Billee. We are a small team, and are all equally passionate in our specific fields. Working with this team has given me amazing opportunities to learn things that I never would've picked up on my own.

I also make videos about math and computer science on YouTube. I have always loved teaching, and making these videos is a way for me to express my creativity.

###### Reach out

I am always excited to meet people, if anything I do interests you, don't hesitate to reach out!
