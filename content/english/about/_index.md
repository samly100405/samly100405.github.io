###### My interests

I am currently studying Computer Science at Cal Poly Pomona, with a minor in Mathematics. I have always been a math geek, and have been programming since I was in middle school. I am extremely passionate about what I do and love (almost) every second of it.

I love anything related to math and computer science. I love delving into papers about things far beyond my comprehension and obsessing over it for days, until I have the slightest inkling of understanding.

Currently, I am working on a robotics team known as Project Billee. We are a small team, and are all equally passionate in our specific fields. Working with this team has given me amazing opportunities to learn things that I never would've picked up on my own.

###### Other hobbies

When I am not nose deep in some paper or putting together documents for my robotics team, I am probably practicing my pentatonic scales on guitar. I have been playing on and off for a couple years, but I've been taking practicing and learning proper technique more seriously as of late. My greatest influences are BB King and John Mayer (I know, basic, but it's what I like).
